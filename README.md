# Healthcare Cost Transparency System

## üè• Overview
A healthcare cost prediction system consisting of two main components: a **REST API** for machine learning predictions and a **web application** for user interface and data management. The API provides accurate treatment cost estimation and medical procedure classification using advanced ML algorithms, while the web application (developed using waterfall methodology) offers a complete healthcare management interface.

## üéØ Key Features

### ü§ñ REST API (Prediction Service)
- **Cost Prediction**: Utilizes LightGBM algorithm to predict medical treatment costs
- **Medical Action Classification**: Employs Random Forest algorithm to classify required medical procedures
- **Real-time Processing**: High-performance .NET Core C# API for instant predictions
- **ONNX Model Integration**: Optimized model deployment and inference

### üåê Web Application (Healthcare Management System)
- **Complete Healthcare Interface**: Comprehensive web application built with Next.js and TypeScript
- **User Management**: Secure login system for medical personnel
- **Prediction Dashboard**: Interface to consume API predictions
- **ICD Management**: Full CRUD operations for ICD code database
- **Prediction History**: Track and review previous cost predictions
- **Waterfall Development**: Systematic development approach ensuring reliability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
- **.NET Core C#** - High-performance REST API
- **LightGBM** - Machine learning for cost prediction
- **Random Forest** - Medical procedure classification
- **ONNX** - Model serialization and deployment

### Frontend
- **Next.js** - React-based web framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface

### Machine Learning
- **LightGBM** - Gradient boosting for cost prediction
- **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning for classification
- **Historical Data Analysis** - Patient data from 2020-2023

## üìä System Architecture
The system consists of two independent but integrated components:

### üîß REST API (Prediction Service)
- **Focused Purpose**: Exclusively handles ML predictions
- **ML Models**: LightGBM for cost prediction, Random Forest for classification
- **ONNX Integration**: Optimized model serving and inference
- **Stateless Design**: Pure prediction service without data persistence

### üåê Web Application (Management System)
- **Waterfall Development**: Systematic approach with clear phases
- **Complete Interface**: Full healthcare management system
- **API Integration**: Consumes prediction API for ML functionality
- **Data Management**: Handles user authentication, history, and ICD management

## üîß API Endpoints (Prediction Service Only)

### Cost Prediction
```
POST /CpCost
```
Accepts patient medical data and returns accurate cost estimates using LightGBM.

### Medical Classification  
```
POST /CpClasif
```
Processes medical data and provides medical action recommendations using Random Forest.

**Note**: API is stateless and focused solely on prediction tasks. No data storage or user management.

## üìã Input Parameters
- **Primary ICD**: Main diagnosis code
- **Secondary ICD**: Additional diagnosis codes (up to 3)
- **Length of Stay**: Hospitalization duration in days
- **Patient Type**: General or special program patient
- **Referral Code**: Patient referral origin identifier

## üé® User Interface
- **Login Page**: Secure authentication for medical personnel
- **Prediction Dashboard**: Main interface for cost estimation
- **History Management**: View and track previous predictions
- **ICD Management**: Comprehensive ICD code database with CRUD operations

## üîç Key Innovations
1. **Microservice Architecture**: Separate API service focused purely on ML predictions
2. **Dual-Model Approach**: LightGBM for cost prediction, Random Forest for classification
3. **Explainable AI**: Transparent and interpretable prediction results
4. **Waterfall Web Development**: Systematic development ensuring reliability and maintainability
5. **Service Integration**: Seamless communication between prediction API and web application
6. **ONNX Optimization**: Efficient model deployment and inference

## üìà Benefits
- **For Patients**: Better financial planning with accurate cost estimates
- **For Hospitals**: Improved budget management and operational efficiency
- **For Medical Staff**: Data-driven decision making for treatment planning
- **For Healthcare System**: Enhanced transparency and cost management
